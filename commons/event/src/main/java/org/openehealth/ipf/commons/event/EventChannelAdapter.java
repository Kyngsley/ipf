 * Base class for channel adapter implementations
 * <p>
 * Channel adapters are called by the framework to consume events published
 * via the local engine. Consuming events leads to the distribution of the
 * event via the channel that is encapsulated by this adapter.
 * A channel adapter is also responsible for accepting messages from the 
 * channel and distributing them to the local event engine via 
 * {@link EventEngine#distributeToHandlers}.
 * <p>
 * Adapters can deny event object distribution if they do not provide the
 * necessary quality of service. In this case {@link #accepts} returns
 * <code>false</code> and {@link #send} is not called by the engine.
